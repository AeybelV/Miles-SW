# TDK ICM-20948 IMU

The TDK ICM-20948 is a high-performance, low-power Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
that combines a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and 3-axis magnetometer
in a single package. It is designed for applications requiring precise motion tracking
and orientation, making it an ideal choice for robotics, drones, and other
motion-sensitive devices.

## Key Features

- **9-Axis MotionTracking:** Combines accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
  for full 9-axis motion sensing.
- **Ultra-Low Power Consumption:** Designed for battery-powered applications with
  advanced power management capabilities.
- **Wide Range of Configurations:** Configurable output data rates, full-scale ranges,
  and filtering options.
- **I2C and SPI Interfaces:** Supports both I2C and SPI communication protocols for
  flexible integration.
